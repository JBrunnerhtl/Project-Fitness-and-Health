# Nutrition page future plans

The goal of the nutrition page is to help people, especially people with disabilities to achieve their daily nutrition goal by creating a diet plan for the whole day by using AI.

To implement this, there will be a calculator form to fill out with different information, for example: height,weight,activity level,further disabilities/eating dissorders/conditions and so on. This data will be given to an AI that will create a nutrition plan that satisfies this specific persons needs. The plan will be nicely structured in a table that you can see on the nutrtion page right now.
